## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword; it's a transformative force in web development. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are changing how we write code, debug issues, and even design user interfaces.

## The Rise of Coding Assistants

Coding assistants have become indispensable for many developers. They speed up the initial boilerplate setup and provide intelligent suggestions that can prevent common errors.

### Benefits
- **Speed**: Write code faster.
- **Learning**: improved understanding of new libraries.
- **Testing**: Automated test generation.

## Conclusion

As AI continues to evolve, developers who adapt and integrate these tools into their workflows will find themselves more productive and capable of building more complex systems.
